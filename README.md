# **Computer Vision Implementations**

This repository contains implementations of fundamental and advanced computer vision techniques, focusing on image processing, feature extraction, and computational vision methods.

## **Features**
- **Image Processing** – RGB channel extraction, grayscale conversion, histogram equalization
- **Edge Detection** – Sobel, Prewitt, and Laplacian operators
- **Feature Detection** – Harris corner detection, Hough transform for line and circle detection
- **Optical Flow** – Motion estimation using Lucas-Kanade method
- **Stereo Vision** – Disparity map generation and correlation matching
- **Camera Calibration** – Pose recovery through Essential Matrix using the 8-Point Algorithm

## **Getting Started**
### **Prerequisites**
- MATLAB (or OpenCV if using Python)
- Basic understanding of image processing concepts

### **Usage**
Clone the repository and run the scripts in MATLAB or Python:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Computer-Vision.git
cd Computer-Vision
```
For MATLAB:
```matlab
run('script_name.m')
```
For Python:
```bash
python script_name.py
```
